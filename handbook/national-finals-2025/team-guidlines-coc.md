# Team Guidelines

To ensure smooth presentations, please carefully follow these guidelines:  

## Technical & Presentation Preparation  

- Ensure that your **project files and presentation** are available with **all team members** as a backup.  
  - If one laptop fails, another teammate should have everything ready.  
- The laptop you use on stage must have an **HDMI port**.  
  - Avoid relying on Type-C adapters or MacBooks, as they may cause last-minute connectivity issues.  
- **Practice your pitch as a team** before the finals. Some effective ways:  
  - Do at least 2–3 **mock runs** with a timer (4 min pitch + 4 min Q&A).  
  - Simulate the stage setup (switching between slides and demo).  
  - Rotate who answers different types of judge questions to build confidence.  
- Keep introductions short.  
  - A simple *“We are Team [Name], from [College/City]”* is enough.  
  - Focus your time on the project, not lengthy intros.  
- Judges expect to see a **working demo**.  
  - Practice smooth transitions between slides and demo.  
  - Make sure your demo runs offline in case of internet issues.  

## Interaction with Judges  

- Be **respectful and professional** when answering questions.  
- Judges only want to understand your project better – treat it as a chance to showcase your hard work, not a grilling session.  
- If you don’t know an answer, it’s okay to say so, honesty is valued more than making something up.  


## Code of Conduct  

- Be kind and respectful to other teams, mentors, and organizers.  
- Build connections – this hackathon is also about networking and collaboration.  
- Celebrate everyone’s effort – winning is important, but so is learning and sharing.  


## Final Note  

Relax, don’t take too much pressure, and enjoy the experience.  
This is your moment—live it fully, present with confidence, and have fun! 🚀
