By leveraging MeTTa‚Äôs knowledge representation, you can design a system that not only maps familial connections but also auto-infers relationships‚Äîlike grandparents, cousins, or more nuanced links. The added capability to calculate ethnicity percentages inherited from parents gives users a more engaging and educational way to explore their heritage.</p><h3 id="challenge" tabindex="-1">Challenge <a class="header-anchor" href="#challenge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Challenge&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Dynamic Relationship Mapping:</strong> Automatically infer familial connections such as grandparents, cousins, and extended relatives.</li><li><strong>Ethnicity Calculation:</strong> Compute inherited ethnicity percentages based on parental lineage.</li><li><strong>Interactive Visualization:</strong> Provide an intuitive interface that dynamically updates as new family data is added.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Representation with MeTTa:</strong> Utilize MeTTa‚Äôs framework to structure and analyze ancestral relationships efficiently.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Ensure the system can expand to accommodate large, multi-generational family trees.</li></ul><h3 id="key-features" tabindex="-1">Key Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Features&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Dynamic Relationship Mapping:</strong> Automatically infer extended family roles (e.g., aunts, uncles, cousins) using graph-based logic.</li><li><strong>Ethnicity Calculation:</strong> Calculate and display how various ethnic backgrounds pass down through each generation.</li><li><strong>Interactive Visualization:</strong> Present a graphical family tree that updates in real-time as new members or data points are added.</li><li><strong>User-Friendly Data Entry:</strong> Provide a simple interface for users to input relationships, ensuring minimal friction when building out the family network.</li></ul><h3 id="impact" tabindex="-1">Impact <a class="header-anchor" href="#impact" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Impact&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>A robust, visually engaging family tree application can spark curiosity, encourage historical research, and foster a deeper connection to one‚Äôs roots.
