# Judging Criteria

## Stage 1: Participation & Progress (50%)

Judges circulate throughout the venue, visiting each team's booth for brief discussions (5-7 minutes). Teams present their progress focusing on:

-  Development stage (have they identified core functionalities?)
-  Challenges encountered and solutions explored.

Publish your project ahead of time on GitHub with correct naming conventions. Also, only if you submit the project and present you will be considered a participant of this hackathon. Just showing up at Hackathon doesnâ€™t count.

## Stage 2: Final Showcase & Awards (50%)

All teams present their final projects to the judges. Focus on:

- Completed functionalities and overall user experience.    
- Impact and Potential
    - Relevance: How relevant is the solution to the stated problem or challenge?
	- Potential Impact: What is the potential impact of the solution? Is it scalable or applicable beyond the hackathon?
- Presentation and Communication
    - Clarity: How clearly is the idea presented? Can the judges understand the project easily?
    - Engagement: Does the team effectively communicate the significance and value of their project?
