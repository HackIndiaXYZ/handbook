# Track Guidelines

As you embark on this exciting journey, itâ€™s essential to align your project with one of the official tracks: **Web3, AI, SingularityNET,** or **Open Track**. This document will guide you in selecting the right track, understanding its significance, and exploring the possibilities for innovation.

## Track 1: Web3 - The Future of Decentralization

Web3 represents the next phase of the internet, shifting from centralized platforms to decentralized networks. Built on blockchain technology, Web3 enables secure, transparent, and trustless interactions, revolutionizing industries such as finance, gaming, and identity management.

### Why Web3?

- **Decentralization:** Eliminates reliance on central authorities.
- **Security & Transparency:** Data is immutable and trustless.
- **Ownership & Interoperability:** Users have full control over digital assets.

## Track 2: AI - Transforming the Future with Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries by enabling machines to learn, reason, and make decisions. With advancements in generative AI, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP), AI is solving complex problems across healthcare, automation, and beyond.

### Why AI?

- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** AI can analyze vast datasets and provide insights.
- **Automation & Efficiency:** Reduces manual effort and increases productivity.
- **Personalization & Adaptability:** AI-driven systems improve user experiences.

## Track 3: SingularityNET

SingularityNET is the title sponsor of HackIndia 2025 and is pioneering a decentralized approach to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Build your solution using SingularityNETâ€™s ecosystem, tools, and APIs to create innovative AI-powered dApps and services on the blockchain.

> :bulb: **SingularityNET developers will be on-site to provide hands-on support, mentorship, and technical guidance throughout the hackathon.** 

### Why SingularityNET?
- **Decentralized AI:** Combine the power of AI and blockchain in a unified ecosystem.
- **AGI-Focused:** Contribute towards the long-term vision of Artificial General Intelligence.
- **Real-World Impact:** Use powerful, ethical AI tools built for social good.

## Track 4: Open Track â€“ Build What Matters to You

Have a brilliant idea that doesnâ€™t neatly fit into a predefined problem statement? The Open Track is your space to innovate with full creative freedomâ€”you define your own problem statement and build something you're truly passionate about.

> ðŸ”¥ Note: Your project must still be focused on either Web3 or AI technologies.

Whether it's a new decentralized social platform, an AI-powered mental health app, or a fusion of bothâ€”this track encourages bold thinking and original solutions.

### Why Open Track?
- **Custom Problem Statement:** Solve a problem that resonates with you or your community.
- **Creative Freedom:** Explore topics and tools that excite you.
- **Tech Focus Required:** Projects must leverage either Web3 or AI as the core technology.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Innovation:** Combine domains and ideas in novel ways.


## Final Thoughts

Your project must belong to **one** of the four official tracks. While there may be overlaps between tracks (e.g., AI + Web3), it is important to define your projectâ€™s **primary focus** during submission.

This hackathon is an opportunity to **build real-world solutions, push technological boundaries, and showcase your talent on a national stage**. Choose a track that excites you, innovate boldly, and letâ€™s create the future together! ðŸš€
