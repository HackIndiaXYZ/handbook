# Track Guidelines

As you embark on this exciting journey, itâ€™s essential to align your project with one of the two tracks: Web3 or AI. This document will guide you in selecting the right track, understanding its significance, and exploring the possibilities for innovation.

## Track 1: Web3 - The Future of Decentralization

Web3 represents the next phase of the internet, shifting from centralized platforms to decentralized networks. Built on blockchain technology, Web3 enables secure, transparent, and trustless interactions, revolutionizing industries such as finance, gaming, and identity management.

### Why Web3?

- **Decentralization:** Eliminates reliance on central authorities.
- **Security & Transparency:** Data is immutable and trustless.
- **Ownership & Interoperability:** Users have full control over digital assets.

## Track 2: AI - Transforming the Future with Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries by enabling machines to learn, reason, and make decisions. With advancements in generative AI, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP), AI is solving complex problems across healthcare, automation, and beyond.

### Why AI?

- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** AI can analyze vast datasets and provide insights.
- **Automation & Efficiency:** Reduces manual effort and increases productivity.
- **Personalization & Adaptability:** AI-driven systems improve user experiences.

## Final Thoughts

Your project must belong to **one of the two tracksâ€”Web3 or AI**. While there may be intersections between the two fields (e.g., AI-powered smart contracts), it is important to define your projectâ€™s **primary focus**.

This hackathon is an opportunity to **build real-world solutions, push technological boundaries, and showcase your talent on a national stage**. Choose a track that excites you, innovate, and letâ€™s create the future together!
