# Open Track

**Your Idea. Your Problem. Your Innovation.**

Welcome to the **Open Track**—the playground for builders who want to break the mold. If you've got a powerful idea that doesn’t fit within a predefined problem statement, this is your chance to make it real.

In the Open Track, **you define your own problem statement**, build your own solution, and show the world what innovation means to you.

## 🧠 What Is the Open Track?
The Open Track is designed for teams who want complete creative control. You can work on **any real-world problem**, design your own use case, and build something meaningful. The only rule? Your project must be rooted in **either Web3 or AI**.

Whether you’re tackling digital identity with blockchain or building an AI assistant to support mental health—this track gives you the space to think big, go deep, and stand out.

## 🛠️ What You Can Build
Some ideas to spark your creativity:

- A **decentralized platform** to verify academic credentials
- An **AI-powered app** that detects fake news in real-time
- A **Web3-native crowdfunding tool** for local communities
- A **personalized learning assistant** using LLMs
- A **fusion project** like an AI model that interacts with smart contracts

The sky’s the limit—as long as it’s Web3 or AI at its core.

HackIndia is about pushing boundaries—and the Open Track is where the wildest ideas come alive. If you’ve been waiting for permission to dream big, build bold, and lead with passion—this is it.

**Go build. Go disrupt. Go inspire.**
