## Project: Optimal Flight Route Finder

###  Overview
Finding the most efficient flight route between cities can be challenging due to multiple factors such as layovers, travel time, and cost. Traditional flight booking systems often present overwhelming amounts of data without optimizing for user preferences. A pathfinding algorithm tailored to flight routes can help travelers identify the best options while balancing key criteria like distance, duration, and layover efficiency.

### Challenge
- **Determine Shortest Travel Time:** Calculate the fastest route between two cities by minimizing total travel duration, including layovers.
- **Layover Optimization:** Analyze airline schedules to ensure the most time-efficient connections.
- **Real-World Data Integration:** Utilize airline route data to provide accurate and up-to-date recommendations.
- **Optimized Pathfinding Algorithm:** Implement algorithms like Dijkstra‚Äôs or A* to compute the most efficient travel paths.

### Key Features
- **Optimized Pathfinding:** Utilize algorithms like Dijkstra‚Äôs or A* or anyother algorithm  to compute the most efficient flight routes.
- **Custom Weighting:** Allow users to prioritize factors such as cost, duration, or number of layovers.
- **Real-World Data Integration:** Leverage airline route data to provide accurate and dynamic flight path recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Input System:** Let users specify departure and destination cities while refining search criteria.

### Impact
This system will simplify flight route planning by providing optimized travel recommendations tailored to user needs. By focusing on efficiency and transparency, it can enhance trip planning for frequent travelers, business professionals, and budget-conscious passengers alike.
