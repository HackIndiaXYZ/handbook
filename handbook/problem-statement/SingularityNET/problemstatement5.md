## Project: MeTTa Building  BASIX  Marketplace - Blockchain-Powered Phigital Asset Exchange  


###  Overview
Current platforms for trading tokenized assets lack robust integration between physical items and their digital representations. Existing marketplaces typically operate with limited autonomous functionality and rely on centralized systems for managing ownership. There is a growing need for decentralized marketplaces that can intelligently handle the complexities of "phigital" assets (physical + digital) while providing transparent ownership structures and value exchange mechanisms.

### Challenge

Develop NFT marketplace using MeTTa that implements:

- A decentralized system for tokenizing, listing, and trading physical items linked to digital assets
- MeTTa-powered autonomous agents that handle key marketplace operations including verification, ownership transfers, and value distribution
- Smart contract integration with blockchain networks (Ethereum, Polygon, or similar)
- Provable connections between physical objects and their corresponding digital tokens

### Technical Requirements

#### Blockchain Implementation
- Connect to a blockchain network (mainnet, testnet, or local development chain)
- Create and deploy smart contracts for NFT minting and marketplace operations
- Enable wallet integration for asset management and transactions

#### MeTTa Development
- Implement most of the core business logic in MeTTa
- Develop knowledge representation, ownership verification, and agent behavior in MeTTa
- Create at least one autonomous agent that handles a key marketplace function

#### Physical-Digital Bridge
- Implement a working proof-of-concept for physical-digital linking (QR, NFC, or other method)
- Ensure verifiable connections between physical items and their digital tokens

#### Complete System Integration
- Demonstrate a complete transaction flow from creation to purchase
- Support wallet connection for viewing owned assets and performing transactions
- Enable proper ownership transfer and verification mechanisms

### Impact

This project introduces blockchain development and MeTTa programming in a practical application with real-world potential for artists, creators, and businesses looking to tokenize physical assets while maintaining transparent ownership records and automated operations.
