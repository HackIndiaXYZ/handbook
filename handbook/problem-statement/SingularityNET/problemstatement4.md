## Project: Family Tree and Ethnicity Builder

###  Overview
Many family history tools struggle to provide a dynamic view of ancestral relationships, relying solely on static data entries. By leveraging MeTTa‚Äôs knowledge representation, you can design a system that not only maps familial connections but also auto-infers relationships‚Äîlike grandparents, cousins, or more nuanced links. The added capability to calculate ethnicity percentages inherited from parents gives users a more engaging and educational way to explore their heritage.

### Challenge
- **Dynamic Relationship Mapping:** Automatically infer familial connections such as grandparents, cousins, and extended relatives.
- **Ethnicity Calculation:** Compute inherited ethnicity percentages based on parental lineage.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Provide an intuitive interface that dynamically updates as new family data is added.
- **Knowledge Representation with MeTTa:** Utilize MeTTa‚Äôs framework to structure and analyze ancestral relationships efficiently.
- **Scalability:** Ensure the system can expand to accommodate large, multi-generational family trees.


### Key Features
- **Dynamic Relationship Mapping:** Automatically infer extended family roles (e.g., aunts, uncles, cousins) using graph-based logic.
- **Ethnicity Calculation:** Calculate and display how various ethnic backgrounds pass down through each generation.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Present a graphical family tree that updates in real-time as new members or data points are added.
- **User-Friendly Data Entry:** Provide a simple interface for users to input relationships, ensuring minimal friction when building out the family network.


### Impact
A robust, visually engaging family tree application can spark curiosity, encourage historical research, and foster a deeper connection to one‚Äôs roots. From casual genealogy enthusiasts to serious researchers, this platform can help educate, entertain, and uncover fascinating insights into family origins and ethnic backgrounds.

#### Learning outcomes
- Knowledge representation in MeTTa
- Algorithm implementation in MeTTa
- Atomspace manipulation
