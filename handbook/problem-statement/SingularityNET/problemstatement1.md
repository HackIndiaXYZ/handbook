## Project: Domain-Specific FAQ Chatbot with Knowledge Graph Integration

###  Overview
Traditional chatbots often rely solely on predefined responses or general-purpose AI models, leading to shallow answers that lack domain-specific depth. They struggle to understand complex relationships, hierarchies, and contextual dependencies within a specialized field. This results in inaccurate or incomplete responses, making them unreliable for industry-specific use cases.

### Challenge
Develop a domain-specific FAQ chatbot that:
- Integrates a knowledge graph for real-time contextual understanding.
- Understands relationships, hierarchies, and dependencies within a domain.
- Provides insightful, structured, and fact-enriched answers beyond standalone AI models.
- Supports real-time updates as new knowledge is added to the graph.
- Enhances responses with definitions, examples, and contextual references from structured data.


### Key Features
- **Conversational AI + Knowledge Graph:** Combines NLP (LLM) with structured data.
- **Context-Aware Answers:** Leverages relationships and hierarchies for deeper insights.
- **Real-Time Data Access:** Fetches the latest domain-specific facts dynamically.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Updates the knowledge graph with new insights over time.
- **Multi-Format Support:** Responds with text, images, links, and interactive elements.

### Impact
This chatbot will transform industry-specific FAQs by providing more accurate, contextual, and enriched responses. It will enable businesses to automate complex queries, improve customer support, and enhance knowledge management through AI-powered intelligence.
