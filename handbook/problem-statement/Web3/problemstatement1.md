## Project: DAA — Decentralized Attendance App

**Category:** Identity / Education / Infra

**Difficulty:** Intermediate – Advanced

### 🧠 Core Idea:
Build a blockchain-based attendance system that eliminates forgery, proxies, and tampering by logging every attendance event on-chain. Every student/employee has a unique wallet address or digital identity, and attendance entries are made through QR scans, NFC tags, or biometric triggers that sign and store data on-chain.


### 🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas:
- Smart Contracts: Solidity / Cairo (if using Starknet)
- Identity Layer: ENS / World ID / Lens Protocol or phone#-based zkAuth
- Frontend: React or Next.js with EVM wallet (Metamask, RainbowKit)
- Infra: Polygon, Avalanche, Base (for fast + low-fee chains)

### 🗃️ Data Sources:
- Simulate or use anonymized attendance logs from college CRMs
- Use dummy biometric device outputs (CSV/json of timestamps)

### 🧩 Bonus Ideas:
- NFT-based “Perfect Attendance” badges
- Generate reports or infographics for teachers/admin
- De-anonymized logs (on-chain hash + off-chain storage via IPFS/Filecoin)
