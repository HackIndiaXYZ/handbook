## Project: FundMyChai – Web3 Crowdfunding for India’s Creators

**Category:** Social Impact / Creator Economy

**Difficulty:** Beginner – Intermediate

### 🧠 Core Idea:
A crypto-native crowdfunding platform for creators, indie hackers, or students. Contributors fund projects transparently, and every rupee raised is traceable. Create milestone-based fund release logic, so funds are unlocked only when progress is validated (on-chain or off-chain).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas:
- Smart Contracts: Solidity with milestone funding logic
- Frontend: Next.js + Metamask / WalletConnect
- Payments: ETH, MATIC, USDC support
- Infra: Celo, Polygon, or Avalanche

### 🗃️ Data Sources:
- Simulated creator projects (art, tech, music)
- Sample donation amounts & milestones from Kickstarter, Ketto, Milaap
- Optional: use WorldCoin or phone# proof to stop spam

### 🧩 Bonus Ideas:
- NFT for donors (e.g., “Early Supporter”)
- DAO governance to approve/dispute milestone completions
- Desi flavor: Raise funds for gaushala, artist events, local causes
