# Problem Statement 2

## Project: NFT Marketplace with Creator-Owned Smart Contracts

###  Overview
Traditional NFT marketplaces often require creators to mint NFTs using platform-controlled smart contracts, limiting their ownership, control, and revenue potential. Creators face high platform fees, restrictions on royalties, and lack of transparency in secondary sales. This reduces the incentive for artists, musicians, and content creators to fully adopt NFTs.

### Challenge
Build an NFT Marketplace with Creator-Owned Smart Contracts that can:
- Allow creators to deploy and manage their own smart contracts for full ownership.
- Enable custom royalty structures to ensure fair earnings on secondary sales.
- Offer decentralized and transparent transactions using blockchain technology.
- Provide multi-chain compatibility to support different blockchain ecosystems.
- Enhance security, scalability, and low gas fees for a seamless user experience.

### Key Features
- Creator-Owned Smart Contracts: No reliance on platform-controlled contracts.
- Custom Royalties: Ensure fair earnings for creators on every resale.
- Decentralized Trading: Transparent and verifiable transactions on-chain.
- Multi-Blockchain Support: Deploy NFTs on Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.
- Gas Optimization: Reduce minting and transaction costs for accessibility.

### Impact
This marketplace will empower creators with full control over their NFTs, ensuring fair earnings, transparency, and decentralization. By eliminating intermediaries and giving creators autonomy, it will redefine digital ownership and NFT commerce.
