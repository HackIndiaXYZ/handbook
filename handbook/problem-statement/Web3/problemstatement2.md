## Project: Proof-of-Peer – Learning Credentials via Soulbound NFTs

**Category:** Identity / Education / Reputation

**Difficulty:** Beginner – Intermediate

### 🧠 Core Idea:
Design a platform that issues soulbound NFTs (non-transferable tokens) to learners for completing online courses, tutorials, workshops, or contributing to open source. Allow peer endorsements and skill ratings directly on-chain. Could also link to GitHub repos or Gitcoin badges.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas:
- Smart Contracts: ERC-721 + ERC-5484 (soulbound spec)
- Frontend: React + Ethers.js or Wagmi
- Storage: Arweave or IPFS for badge metadata
- Infra: Linea, Zora, or Base for NFT minting at low cost

### 🗃️ Data Sources:
- Simulated course completion data (from MOOCs, workshops)
- Open certification providers (Coursera, edX) APIs (if used off-chain)
- GitHub profile stats, pull request logs

### 🧩 Bonus Ideas:
- Skill trees that evolve: NFTs level up based on streaks
- Indian twist: “Certified ChaiCoder,” “React Rani,” “SQL Shera” etc.
- DAO voting for peer-review based endorsements
