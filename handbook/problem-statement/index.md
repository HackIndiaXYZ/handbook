# 🧩 Problem Statements
Choose Your Challenge. Or Create Your Own.

Welcome to the heart of HackIndia—the place where ideas turn into impact. This is your starting point to pick a challenge, define your purpose, and build something extraordinary.

## 🛠️ How It Works
You have two ways to get started:

### ✅ Option 1: Pick from Given Problem Statements
We’ve curated a list of real-world challenges across Web3, AI, and sponsored tracks. These are designed to spark your thinking and help you hit the ground running.

### ✍️ Option 2: Define Your Own Problem Statement
Have a unique idea? Something you’re deeply passionate about solving? You’re welcome to submit your own problem under the Open Track—as long as it’s rooted in Web3 or AI.

## 🔗 Tech Partner Resources
While we encourage you to use tools, APIs, and resources provided by our technology partners to supercharge your solution, it’s not mandatory. Feel free to build with the stack you’re most comfortable with.

> 💡 Pro tip: Leveraging partner tech may give your project an edge in functionality and impact.
