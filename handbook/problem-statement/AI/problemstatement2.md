- Enhance search accuracy using AI-driven context analysis.

### Key Features
- Smart Search: Find documents based on natural language input, not just keywords.
- AI-Powered Summaries: Generate concise summaries of lengthy documents.
- Context-Aware Recommendations: Suggest related files or topics based on the query.
- Multi-Format Support: Process PDFs, Word files, slides, and other common formats.
- Fast & Secure Access: Ensure efficient retrieval while maintaining data security.

### Impact
This solution will boost workplace efficiency by reducing the time spent searching for information. It will streamline knowledge access, improve decision-making, and empower employees with instant insights from large document repositories.
