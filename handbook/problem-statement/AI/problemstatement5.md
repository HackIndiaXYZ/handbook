# Problem Statement 5

## Project: Domain-Specific FAQ Chatbot with Knowledge Graph Integration

###  Overview
Traditional chatbots often rely solely on predefined responses or general-purpose AI models, leading to shallow answers that lack domain-specific depth. They struggle to understand complex relationships, hierarchies, and contextual dependencies within a specialized field. This results in inaccurate or incomplete responses, making them unreliable for industry-specific use cases.

### Challenge
Build a Domain-Specific FAQ Chatbot that:
- Integrates a knowledge graph for real-time contextual understanding.
- Understands relationships, hierarchies, and dependencies within a domain.
- Provides more insightful, structured, and fact-enriched answers than standalone AI models.
- Supports real-time updates as new knowledge is added to the graph.
- Enhances responses with definitions, examples, and contextual references from structured data.

### Key Features
- Conversational AI + Knowledge Graph: Blend NLP with structured ontology-based knowledge.
- Context-Aware Answers: Leverage relationships and hierarchies for deeper insights.
- Real-Time Data Access: Fetch the latest domain-specific facts dynamically.
- Adaptive Learning: Update the knowledge graph with new insights over time.
- Multi-Format Support: Respond with text, images, links, and interactive elements.

### Impact
This chatbot will revolutionize industry-specific FAQs by providing more accurate, contextual, and enriched responses. It will enable businesses to automate complex queries, improve customer support, and enhance knowledge management with AI-powered intelligence.
