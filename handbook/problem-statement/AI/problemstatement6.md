# Problem Statement 6

## Project: Context-Aware Personalized Recommendation System with Knowledge Graph

###  Overview
Traditional recommendation systems rely on basic user preferences and past interactions, often leading to generic or repetitive suggestions. They lack contextual awareness, failing to understand deeper relationships between items, such as genres, creators, themes, or concepts. This results in less engaging and insightful recommendations, especially in movies, music, education, and e-commerce domains.

### Challenge
Build a Personalized Recommendation System that:
- Leverages a knowledge graph to enrich recommendations with contextual insights.
- Analyzes user preferences and interactions for better personalization.
- Connects related entities (e.g., recommending a movie based on a similar director, theme, or storytelling style).
- Adapts dynamically to changing user interests and evolving trends.
- Provides diverse yet relevant recommendations beyond just direct matches.

### Key Features
- AI + Knowledge Graph Integration: Blend machine learning with structured domain knowledge.
- Context-Aware Recommendations: Suggest items based on deeper relationships (genres, creators, influences, etc.).
- User Behavior Tracking: Continuously refine suggestions based on interactions.
- Multi-Domain Support: Apply to movies, music, education, books, e-commerce, and more.
- Dynamic & Evolving: Update recommendations as new data is added to the graph.

### Impact
This system will enhance user engagement by offering smarter, more meaningful recommendations. By understanding the context and relationships between entities, it will provide more insightful, diverse, and enjoyable discovery experiences for users.
