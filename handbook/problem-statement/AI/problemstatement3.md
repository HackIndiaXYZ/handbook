# Problem Statement 3

## Responsible AI

This challenge invites students to explore and develop innovative solutions that promote the ethical and responsible use of artificial intelligence. As AI adoption grows, the risks of unethical applications also rise. We encourage students to create solutions that can help regulate the space, such as:


- AI systems that monitor and enforce ethical AI usage.
- Tools to ensure AI safety for children.
- AI-driven bias detection and mitigation frameworks.
- Transparent and explainable AI solutions.
